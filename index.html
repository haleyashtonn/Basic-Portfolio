    <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p class="p1">I am currently a student enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at University of Texas at Austin. I entered this course completely new to coding, and though it's challenging, I am thouroughly enjoying the learning process. I intend to continue to gain further knowledge in programming going forward, and am eager to grow professionally in this field.
        My other hobbies include kayaking, biking, and writing. I love Texas in the summer and I try to spend time outside everyday, if only briefly.
        I have plan to move to Brooklyn and Chicago within the next five years and am excited to bring my programming skillset along with me.</p>
