    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="p1">I am currently a student enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at University of Texas at Austin. I learning coding from scratch, and though it's challenging, I am thouroughly enjoying it so far. I intend to continue to further expand my knowledge going in programming going forward, and am looking forward to growing my professio in this field.</p>
        <p class="p2">My other hobbies include kayaking, biking, and writing. I love Texas in the summer and I try to spend time outside everyday, if only briefly.</p>
        <p class="p3">I have plan to move to Brooklyn and Chicago within the next five years and am excited to bring my programming skillset along with me.</p>
