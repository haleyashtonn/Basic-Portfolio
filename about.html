    <h1>About Me:</h1>

    <p class="p1">For the past five years, I have been a biology and chemistry student. As I neared the end of my studies, 
        I became very curious about programming. It was never introduced to me and I'd always thought the two could go hand in hand.
        I decided to make the change and incorporate into my skills in hopes of becoming more versatile in my professional life.
        I intend to work in many areas in this field in order to decide which area will be my strongest. Front and back end development
        both seem intrigueing to me, but so does the UI/UX field.
